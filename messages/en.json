    "paragraph1": "But The AI and Beyond is not a single person. It's a structure designed to be lean, fast, and precise — where human expertise and AI tools work together on every project.",
    "paragraph2": "When you work with us, you're not working with a freelancer doing everything alone. You're working with a system where every analysis, every automation, every deliverable goes through AI tools that we ourselves use every day. It's our way of proving AI works: we use it before recommending it.",
    "paragraph3": "Our starting point is always the same: where are you losing time, money, or control over a process? From there, we figure out if AI is the right answer. Sometimes it is. Sometimes it's not. Either way, you have a clear picture before a single line of code is written.",
    "paragraph4": "We've worked on systems where errors are costly: industrial maintenance, regulatory compliance, business-critical applications. This taught us one thing: technology that works is technology that disappears from daily life — no one has to think about it.",
